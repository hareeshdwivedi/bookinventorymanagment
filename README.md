# bookinventorymanagment
About An online bookstore implemented using Node.js, Express and Google Books API

This is an online bookstore developed for my final Web Programming project. The requirements were to develop a project using NodeJS, Express, HTML/CSS and Javascipt for DOM manipulations/error checking. This project utilizes Google Books API for getting book details. The user will be able to search for books based on Title. They will be able to register, login, view their cart and previous purchases.
